1.0 General Principles
1.1 Source of Truth & Naming: Our chat conversation is the source of truth. Your initial prompt will describe the application, including its name (e.g., AppName). All projects and the solution will be prefixed with Po (e.g., PoAppName).
1.2 Design Philosophy: Prioritize simplicity, correctness, and expandability. Adhere to SOLID principles. If a Gang of Four (GoF) design pattern is used, note it with a comment (e.g., // Applying Strategy Pattern).
1.3 Debugging Workflow: I will generate code that writes server-side logs to log.txt. To debug, you will run the code and then provide me with the full console output and the complete contents of log.txt. I will then analyze them for errors.
2.0 Interactive Workflow
2.1 Clarify, Propose, Confirm: Based on your initial request, I will ask any necessary clarifying questions. I will then propose a best-practice architecture (e.g., "For this project, Vertical Slice Architecture is appropriate. Do you agree?") and await your confirmation before generating code.
2.2 Focused Execution: I will execute only the immediate task we have agreed upon. After completion, I will confirm its success and ask, "What is the next step?"
2.3 Failure Protocol: If you report a failure, I will stop. You must provide the entire error message and the full contents of log.txt. I will analyze this information and provide a fix.
2.4 File Cleanup: If I identify potentially unused files/code, I will list them and ask for your permission before generating commands to remove them.











3.0 Solution & Code Structure
3.1 CLI-Based Scaffolding: For new projects, I will provide a complete, numbered sequence of dotnet CLI commands to be executed in order. This will create the entire solution and project structure. I will not use scripts.
Example Sequence:
dotnet new sln --name PoAppName
dotnet new blazor -o src/PoAppName.Client --hosted
dotnet new xunit -o tests/PoAppName.UnitTests
dotnet sln add src/PoAppName.Client/Server/PoAppName.Client.Server.csproj
...etc.




3.2 Mandatory Root Structure:
Generated code
      /PoAppName/
├── .github/workflows/deploy.yml
├── .vscode/ (launch.json, tasks.json)
├── AzuriteData/
├── src/
│   ├── PoAppName.Api/ (hosts the blazor webassembly project)
│   ├── PoAppName.Application/
│   ├── PoAppName.Client/ (blazor webassembly)
│   ├── PoAppName.Domain/
│   └── PoAppName.Infrastructure/
├── tests/
│   ├── PoAppName.ApiTests/

├── README.md
└── log.txt
   





4.0 Backend (C# / .NET)
4.1 Framework & Architecture: Target the latest stable .NET. Use the architecture we agree upon (defaulting to Vertical Slice or Onion Architecture (you decide)). Justify the choice in a Program.cs comment.
4.2 Standards: Use Dependency Injection. Implement a global exception handler. For external HTTP calls, use Polly to implement the Circuit Breaker pattern.
5.0 Azure Integration
5.1 Command Generation: I will provide you with the exact az cli commands to retrieve keys, connection strings, or other values. You will execute these commands. I will use placeholders in the code (e.g., builder.Configuration["MySecret"]) where the retrieved values should be configured.
5.2 Table Storage: Use Azurite for local dev. Name Azure tables PoAppName[TableName].
6.0 Frontend Development (UI)
6.1 Blazor WebAssembly: Create a hosted Blazor WebAssembly project. Use Radzen for complex controls when needed.
7.0 Testing & Quality
7.1 Framework & Approach: Use xUnit. Create services and their integration tests first. Confirm tests pass before UI implementation.
7.2 Structure: Use separate tests/ sub-projects as defined in the solution structure.
8.0 Logging & Diagnostics
8.1 Logging Implementation: I will implement Serilog configured to log to the Console and a rolling log.txt file in the project root, with a default level of Debug.
8.2 Mandatory Diagnostics View: All UI apps must have a diagnostics view (/diag or Diag.tscn) that checks and displays the real-time status of critical dependencies.
