The Complete 10-Step Implementation Plan
Project Setup and Infrastructure (Foundation Phase)
Create the Blazor WebAssembly project with default configuration for portrait orientation
Set up the ASP.NET Core Web API project for backend services
Establish the Azure Table Storage resource in the specified resource group
Configure the project structure with necessary folders for components, services, and models
Implement the basic routing between Home, Game, and Leader pages
Create the visual foundation with CSS variables for the kid-friendly theme
Main Menu Implementation (Navigation Phase)
Develop the Home.razor page with responsive layout for portrait orientation
Implement navigation buttons for Play Game and Leaderboard options
Create the animated background effect for visual appeal
Establish the application's visual identity with appropriate typography and color scheme
Build navigation service to handle transitions between different views
Game Screen Foundation (Framework Phase)
Develop the basic structure of Game.razor with score and timer displays
Implement the game area container with appropriate sizing and positioning
Create the countdown timer functionality with one-second precision
Set up the game state management system to track score and game progression
Build the game initialization and reset functions for repeated play sessions
Physics Engine Development (Movement Phase)
Implement the core physics system for circle movement using JavaScript interop
Create velocity and position vectors for each circle entity
Develop collision detection algorithms for boundaries and inter-circle collisions
Implement realistic bounce effects with appropriate momentum transfer
Build the position update loop for smooth animation at an appropriate frame rate
Circle Management System (Entity Phase)
Create the Circle class with properties for position, velocity, color, and person association
Implement the circle generation algorithm with non-overlapping placement
Develop the circle regeneration logic with appropriate delay
Build the touch/click detection system for user interaction
Implement the visual effects for circle disappearance using CSS animations
Backend API Development (Data Phase)
Create the ScoreController with endpoints for retrieving and submitting scores
Implement the ScoreService for Azure Table Storage interaction
Develop the data models and DTOs for score management
Configure CORS policies for secure communication between front and backend
Implement appropriate error handling and validation for all API operations
Leaderboard Implementation (Achievement Phase)
Develop the Leader.razor page with responsive table layout
Implement the data retrieval and display logic for top 10 scores
Create visual styling for rank differentiation (top 3 vs. others)
Build the navigation back to main menu functionality
Implement empty state handling for incomplete leaderboards
Modal Components Development (Interaction Phase)
Create the HighScoreModal component for top score submissions
Implement the initial input field with validation for three letters
Develop the GameOverModal component for end-of-game feedback
Build the API integration for score submission
Implement appropriate animations for modal appearance and dismissal
Audio System Implementation (Feedback Phase)
Create the audio management service to handle sound file loading and playback
Implement the folder structure for Matt, Nick, and Kim sound collections
Develop the random selection algorithm for choosing one of five sounds
Build the audio triggering system tied to circle touch events
Implement preloading strategies to prevent playback delays
Final Integration and Polishing (Completion Phase)
Connect all components into a cohesive gameplay experience
Implement the difficulty progression as the timer counts down
Perform cross-device testing to ensure proper responsiveness
Optimize performance for smooth gameplay on mobile devices
Apply final visual touches and animations for a polished user experience
Conduct comprehensive testing of the leaderboard system and Azure integration
Prepare the application for deployment with appropriate configuration settings
